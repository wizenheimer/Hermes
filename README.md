## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-  [AWS API Gateway]() - A fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
- [AWS Lambda]() - A serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can use it to run code in response to events, such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table, or to run code in response to HTTP requests using AWS API Gateway. In this case, it handles email validation and triggers SES.
- [AWS SQS]() - A fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
- [AWS SES]() - A flexible and scalable email service that enables you to send and receive email using your own email addresses and domains. SES can help you build and maintain customer engagement by sending automated emails, such as welcome messages, password resets, and order confirmations.
